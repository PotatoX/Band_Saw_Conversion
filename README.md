# Band_Saw_Conversion

## Summary
Recently I needed (had an excuse to get) a band saw capable of cutting metal for a few of my projects. As with most of my projects/hobbies there are a number of outcomes I seek:

* Cheep
* Technical
* Build
* Learn

To this end I started shopping around to acquire a band saw as cheap as possible as it would only be used on a limited basis for hobby work. I need the saw to be able to cut metal and fit a small foot print on my bench. I wanted the saw to be vertical in order to minimize the space consumed as my bench and garage space is at a premium at this point.

With these constraints in mind I set my sights on a Harbor Freight 1/3 HP 9 in Benchtop Band Saw. I caught it on sale a Harbor Freight (w/ coupon) for right around $100. Similar saws can be found at your local big box stores.

Using this basic frame and some upgrades I have been able to convert this wood cutting vertical band saw to a metal cutting type with speed control and FPS display.

I now have a small band saw capable of cutting metal, wood, plastic, etc. that fits on the corner of my bench.

This project encompass the conversion and in indented to share the process with other makers. If you have questions, need additional details, or see any bugs please let me know.

The entire project can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/PotatoX/Band_Saw_Conversion/). Consider contributing and making it even better if you happen to create other customizations.

Additionally, I will list parts used in this project on my [OpenBazzar store](https://openbazaar.com/store/QmVFRGwApdcef56Be7FPXnXQaB79rYrve3otFsrWvSwbAu).
